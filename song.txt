We stand at the gates of Berlin
With two and a half million men
With six thousand tanks in our ranks
Use them as battering rams

Artillery leading our way
A million grenades has been launched
The nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken

Marshall Zhukov's orders:
Serve me Berlin on a plate!
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take
